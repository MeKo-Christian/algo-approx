# release-guard.sh — keeps this module releasable and keeps its siblings current.
#
# This exists because of a concrete failure. In August 2026 the algo-* family
# had drifted onto three different algo-fft versions at once: algo-pde pinned
# v0.6.15, algo-dsp pinned v0.7.3, algo-acoustics pinned v0.6.11, and algo-fft's
# own main sat 97 commits past its latest tag with a CHANGELOG section for a
# version nobody had ever tagged. Because algo-fft's generic PlanReal2D and
# PlanReal3D had changed signature between the v0.6 and v0.7 lines, no single
# upgrade anywhere could compile, and untangling it took a full day.
#
# Three distinct mistakes produced that, and this script blocks each one:
#
#   1. Work accumulated on main and was never tagged, so downstream could not
#      take fixes even when they existed.        -> `unreleased`
#   2. Consumers sat on old sibling versions indefinitely, and nothing said so.
#      -> `deps`
#   3. Exported API was removed without the version signalling it. Note that
#      semver EXEMPTS v0.x from this ("anything MAY change at any time"), so
#      `gorelease` alone will happily approve a patch bump across a breaking
#      change. The whole algo-* family is v0.x, so that exemption is exactly
#      the hole we fell through. This script refuses it anyway.  -> `gate`
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/release-guard.sh deps            # sibling deps at their latest tags?
#   scripts/release-guard.sh unreleased      # untagged work sitting on main?
#   scripts/release-guard.sh gate vX.Y.Z     # all release preconditions
#   scripts/release-guard.sh tag  vX.Y.Z     # gate, then create and push the tag
#
# Prefer the justfile wrappers: `just check-deps`, `just release vX.Y.Z`.
